Modifications:

* Minor Modifications:  
  * Increased the angle of the camera and made the camera follow smoother  
  * Made the Gargoyles slowly track the player  
  * Added more map space and a secret ending if you get past the Gargoyle to the left of the start  
* Major Modifications:  
  * Added a new enemy called the Cyclops which has a custom model, material, and animations who rotates around in place

The hardest challenge I faced while making this project was figuring out how to make the Gargoyle track the player as I had to learn how to convert quaternion rotation to euler rotation, which Unity does not have an easy pre-made answer for.

I probably won’t work on this project any further, but if I did I would further polish the Cyclops’s model and animations.
